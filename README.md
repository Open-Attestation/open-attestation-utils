# openattestation-utils

This is a repository that houses shared project logic between Open Attestation and TradeTrust.

### Direct import

If the consuming application does not support treeshaking, you should do direct import instead. Example:

```
import { FiatLabel } from "@govtechsg/open-attestation-utils/components/FiatLabel";
```
